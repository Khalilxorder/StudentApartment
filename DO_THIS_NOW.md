# ðŸŽ¯ THE ONLY THING YOU NEED TO DO - SIMPLIFIED

Everything is done. Here's what YOU need to do:

---

## YOUR JOB (Pick one method):

### **METHOD 1: Super Quick (If you trust automation)**
Just add these 13 GitHub Secrets, then Vercel will auto-detect them.

---

### **METHOD 2: Step by Step (Recommended)**

#### **Step 1:** Add GitHub Secrets (10 min)
Go here: https://github.com/Khalilxorder/StudentApartment/settings/secrets/actions

Click "New repository secret" and add:
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` = Your Google AI key
- `SUPABASE_URL` = Your Supabase URL
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` = Your Supabase service role
- `DATABASE_URL` = Your database connection string
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` = Your Stripe secret
- `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` = Your Stripe webhook secret
- `RESEND_API_KEY` = Your Resend API key
- `MEILISEARCH_HOST` = Your Meilisearch host
- `MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY` = Your Meilisearch key
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = Your Google Maps key
- `SENTRY_DSN` = Your Sentry DSN
- `VERCEL_TOKEN` = Your Vercel token
- `VERCEL_ORG_ID` = Your Vercel org ID
- `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID` = Your Vercel project ID
- `VERCEL_DOMAIN` = Your Vercel domain

#### **Step 2:** Add Vercel Variables (10 min)
Go here: https://vercel.com/dashboard/StudentApartment/settings/environment-variables

Add these variables (check "Production" only):
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` (generate new one)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY`
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- `MEILISEARCH_MASTER_KEY`
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- `SENTRY_DSN`

#### **Step 3:** Test (5 min)
```bash
pnpm dev
# Then search in browser, look in console for: âœ… Gemini AI response:
```

#### **Step 4:** Check GitHub (5 min)
Go to: https://github.com/Khalilxorder/StudentApartment/actions
Wait for green checkmarks âœ…

#### **Step 5:** Check Vercel (5 min)
Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
Verify "Production" shows live, test live site

---

## WHAT YOU'LL SEE

**Console after it works:**
```
âœ… Gemini AI response: { budget: 2000, bedrooms: 2, location: "Cambridge", ... }
```

**If it doesn't show that:**
- Did you add the env vars? (Step 1 & 2)
- Did GitHub Actions show green? (Step 4)
- Did Vercel deployment succeed? (Step 5)
