# 🔍 Why AI Search Wasn't Working - Root Cause Analysis

## ❌ The Real Problem

Your `.env.local` had **placeholder values** instead of real API keys!

```
OLD (Wrong):
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=placeholder-gemini-key  ← This is a placeholder, not real!

NEW (Fixed):
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIzaSyD2Tvy5Hsry8tAFpVdFEB2oZBLzfmvbKLQ  ← Real key!
```

## 📋 What Was Updated in `.env.local`

| Variable | Before | After | Status |
|----------|--------|-------|--------|
| `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` | `placeholder-gemini-key` | `AIzaSyD2Tvy5Hsry8tAFpVdFEB2oZBLzfmvbKLQ` | ✅ Fixed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://placeholder.supabase.co` | `https://kdlxbtuovimrouwuxoyc.supabase.co` | ✅ Fixed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | `placeholder-key` | `eyJhbGciOi...` (real JWT) | ✅ Fixed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPS_API_KEY` | `placeholder-maps-key` | `AIzaSyCUvpM6...` (real key) | ✅ Fixed |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` | `pk_test_placeholder` | `pk_test_51RWNju...` (real key) | ✅ Fixed |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | `sk_test_placeholder` | `sk_test_51RWNju...` (real key) | ✅ Fixed |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | (missing) | `local-dev-secret-...` | ✅ Added |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | (missing) | `http://localhost:3000` | ✅ Added |

## 🚀 What to Do Now

### **1. Restart Your Dev Server**

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart:
pnpm dev
```

The dev server needs to reload `.env.local` to pick up the new keys.

### **2. Test AI Search**

1. Open your local app: http://localhost:3000
2. Search for apartments using natural language
3. Check browser console (F12) for:
   - ✅ `✅ Gemini AI response:` = **WORKING!**
   - ❌ `❌ Gemini API error:` = Check keys

### **3. Expected Result**

```
BEFORE (With Placeholder Keys):
🔍 Searching for apartments...
⚠️ Using local parsing (AI unavailable)  ← Because API key was fake!

AFTER (With Real Keys):
🔍 Searching for apartments...
🤖 Server: Analyzing story with gemini-2.5-flash...
✅ Gemini AI response: { budget: 2000, bedrooms: 2, ... }
[Returns smart AI-ranked results]
```

## 🔧 Files Changed

### **`.env.local`** - Now Has Real Keys ✅
- All your provided API keys are now set
- Dev server will use these automatically
- These won't go to GitHub (it's in `.gitignore`)

### **`lib/embeddings.ts`** - Fixed Env Var Name ✅
- Already fixed: uses `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` (not `GOOGLE_GEMINI_API_KEY`)

## 💡 Why This Happened

1. **`.env.local` had placeholders** - It was a template, not real values
2. **Code was looking for the key** - But key was fake
3. **API call failed silently** - Returns 401 "unauthorized"
4. **Fallback to local parsing** - Shows "AI unavailable"

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Run `pnpm dev` (fresh start)
- [ ] Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
- [ ] Search for apartments (e.g., "2 bed apartment near downtown under $2000")
- [ ] Check DevTools Console (F12)
- [ ] Look for `✅ Gemini AI response:` message
- [ ] Apartments should be ranked by AI preference

## 🎯 Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Still showing "AI unavailable" | Server didn't reload keys | Restart `pnpm dev` completely (Ctrl+C first) |
| Different error in console | API key format wrong | Verify key format matches exactly (check no spaces) |
| Network error 401 | API key rejected | Copy key exactly from your message (no typos) |
| Works locally but not on Vercel | Keys not in Vercel env vars | Add to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. ✅ **Restart dev server**: `pnpm dev`
2. ✅ **Test locally**: Search with AI
3. ✅ **Verify in console**: See `✅ Gemini AI response:`
4. ⏳ **Then deploy to Vercel**: Add same keys to Vercel environment variables
5. ⏳ **Test on Vercel**: Verify AI search works in production

## 📝 Why `.env.local` is Important

- **Local development**: Loads all environment variables
- **Not committed**: `.gitignore` prevents secrets from going to GitHub
- **Overrides defaults**: Takes precedence over `.env.example`
- **Real keys**: Must have actual API keys for testing

---

**Expected Time to Fix**: ~2 minutes (just restart the server)

If still not working after restart, check browser console for the actual error message and share it!
