# API Documentation Progress

## ✅ Completed

### Infrastructure
- [x] Swagger packages installed
- [x] swagger.config.ts with OpenAPI 3.0
- [x] Core schemas defined (Apartment, Booking, Message, etc.)
- [x] /api/docs Swagger UI route
- [x] /api/docs/spec OpenAPI endpoint

### Documented Endpoints
- [x] POST /api/search - Hybrid search with filters
- [ x] POST /api/apartments - Create apartment listing

### Remaining (Quick Documentation Pattern)
- [ ] GET /api/apartments/[id] - Get apartment details
- [ ] POST /api/messages - Send message
- [ ] GET /api/messages - Get conversations
- [ ] POST /api/bookings - Create booking
- [ ] POST /api/payments/create-intent - Create payment
- [ ] POST /api/favorites - Add favorite
- [ ] POST /api/reviews - Submit review

## Status

**Completed:** 2/9 core endpoints  
**Time Spent:** ~1h  
**Pattern Established:** Yes ✅

**Next:** Document remaining 7 endpoints (1-2h) OR move to next priority

## Score Impact

- Current: 83/100
- With full docs: ~88/100 (+5 points)
- With infrastructure only: ~84/100 (+1 point)

**Recommendation:** Infrastructure is solid. Can document remaining endpoints later if time-constrained.
